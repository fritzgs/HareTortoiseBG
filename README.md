### Gameplay
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_and_Tortoise)</br>
Players pay carrots (currency of the game) to move forward. </br>

The more squares the player wants to advance, the more carrots the player must pay.

* 1 square  = 1 carrot.
* 2 squares = 1 square  +  2  = 3 carrots.
* 3 squares = 2 squares +  3  = 6 carrots.
* 4 squares = 3 squares +  4  = 10 carrots.
etc.

</br>
Players can earn carrots in the following ways:
1. Moving backwards (10 carrots per square)
2. Cards

Each player starts with 65 carrots.
There are 65 squares on the board.
* The squares have different types
* 1. Hare square - Draw a card 
* 2. Carrots     - Get extra carrots for each turn skipped
* etc.
